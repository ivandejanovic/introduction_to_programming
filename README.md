# Introduction to Programming

Introduction to programming is free open source introductionary course to computer programming.

## Who is this course for
Technically anybody can use this course if they so wish. My idea when creating this course was to give some, hopefully easy to follow, material for people who have none or very little experience in programming.

In todays day and age it is pretty easy to find resources online that explain how to do pretty much everything. Problem with these resources is still the same as in ages past. If you are an absolute beginner on the topic finding resources that will actually help you start and build a proper foundation on which you can continue to build is not easy. 

Problem may have even became more difficult in recent times since now there are more resources than ever and finding the right for you can be challenging. Hopefully this material will be helpful if you are just dipping your toes in the computer programming.

If you have any suggestions on how this material can be improved please let me know.

## How is this course organized
This course contains a book, that is intended to serve as any other book in computer programming. Written material on topics going from most basic to the more advanced ones.

Alongside the book there will be code examples for each chapter. Examples will be presented in two folders

- exercises
- complete_exercises

First will contain incomplete files for student to make changes as described in the chapter lesson.
Second will contain solution which student can use to verify the changes made or to see what the solution is if they experienced issues.
